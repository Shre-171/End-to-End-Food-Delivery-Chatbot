# End-to-End-Food-Delivery-Chatbot
This repository showcases an end-to-end food delivery chatbot system integrating Dialogflow for natural language understanding and response generation, alongside a FastAPI-based Python backend for server-side operations and MySQL for data management.
# Key Components:
1-Dialogflow Integration: Configured and deployed conversational agents using Dialogflow to handle user queries and generate responses.

2-Backend Development (Python, FastAPI): Developed a robust backend in Python using FastAPI to facilitate seamless communication between the chatbot interface and the server.

3-MySQL Database: Orchestrated interactions with MySQL to store and manage data related to orders, menu items, and order tracking.

4-NLP Techniques: Applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques to interpret and respond effectively to user queries, enhancing user experience and interaction flow.
